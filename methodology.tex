% talk about ROI, what it is, why it is important
Our proposed approach further integrates the similarity information with the framework
to capture the similar patterns from the referred objects.  Below we further describes
the Factorization Machines and the difference between our approach.


\section{Standard Factorization Machine}
Factorization Machines can act like most factorization models by feeding various
types of features. ...

\section{Grouping Factorization Machine}
Factorization Machines provide a good framework for modeling the interactions
between features, but sometimes similar type of features may cause confusion
while learning, especially with a large number of features. ...
